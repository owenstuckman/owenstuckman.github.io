    <p>Worked in a team of four to make an AI cooking assistant. It provided feedback on a wide variety of inputs, such as cooking time, and whether items were spoiled or not. I primarily worked on the UI in Unity and made the dictation tool to enable voice commands, which then communicated with our backend to provide the requested service.</p>
