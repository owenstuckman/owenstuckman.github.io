The following is a reflection of my time working with Sparklii LLC, and building a date ideas app (which started in high school), and was my first introduction to a major project and to building a business in general.

All of the notes are from an extended meeting we had, and highlighted our journey. These are my personal notes of the biggest major points of what I learned. 

# Lessons

## Business Perspective

- needed to fail significantly faster
- needed to be data first, growth was clearly not there 
- earlier pivot would have made more sense
- planned ahead on partnerships and whatnot when we had no market validation or user base
- burnt way too much for too many months

## Development Standpoint
- architectural mistakes with some of the data structure, particularly with likes and things like that 
	- did not fully leverage relational db at times, and utilized json
		- json is not awesome to work with in flutter, much easier with js or ts
- was learning at the time, so def could have made better decisions in hindsight 
- definitely would stick with a BaaS/FaaS provider in the future, made things significantly easier and quicker
- would have made much rougher drafts and just released, sharpen the ui much later
- lots of time spent on minor UI tweaks or revisions when should have been on core product
- would use flutter again, but probably would now make a webapp mvp possibly, then shift to flutter depending on userbase
- challenging to dev without daily standups, challenges with both John and I having to more or less tackle larger projects on own just because of time constraints 
- egress issues should have been avoided

## My Personal Takeaways:

- name is not that important, just build
- should leverage wireframes/power and easy apps to make it really easy to see the concept and show to people 
- faster iterations, quicker pivots and documenting
- should have worked with users on day to day, was not building anything significant 
- find proper channels early, for ex: LI was not working 
- legal for apple is a struggle, get it done early 
- transparency in the journey makes things very understandable 
- do a lot more research on the apple submissions 
- launch days are only if the app is approved and good to go for a while 
- use a CRM as early as possible 
- go native early, or be specific 
- own your own IP, don't be limited by another company 
- keep all the content on your own stuff, we lost a ton of content due to working with another business 
- free labor does nothing 
- not great launch, build more hype, should hype when all set 
- gotta spend money to make money 
- tech debt acquired pretty quick, need to focus on core features 
- high quality story telling was a great pitch and got a lot of hype, and showed a lot of drive 
- should focus on small groups 
- validation is so much more important, finding the niche, rather than targeting a very broad group of people 
- talk is cheap, very much needed it to be niche, needed to be data guided significantly earlier
- need to be connected customers always 
- USE SOMETHING LIKE POSTHOG, NEED TO BE VERY DATA DRIVEN, AND MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE DATA ITSELF (POSTHOG WORKS WITH FLUTTER)
- READ ALL CONTRACTS, MAKE SURE TO NOT GET HOOKED
- virality does not convert to downloads 
- if paying for something, drive the direction, ensure to enforce it 
- reddit organic marketing does kinda work
- DATA AND NUMBERS DRIVE A TON OF IT, NEED TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LIKE SITTING AND ACTING LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT
- marketing in public works, is actually effective
- need a very clear business model 
- don't spread thin on socials
- be VERY CAREFUL WITH TRADEMARKS, SCAMS ARE FREQUENT 
- go angel tbh
- DONT AUTOMATE IT UNTIL ITS A PROBLEM
- founder market fit also helps 
- TALK TO COMPETITORS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE

## Final Thoughts
