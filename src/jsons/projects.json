The app uses crowdsourced data to identify and recommend the safest walking routes, similar to how Waze works for driving. Features include an interactive map with community threat/safety markers, smart route planning, panic button, heat map of reported incidents, group walk system, college selection, and alternate transportation recommendations. Built with Expo React Native and styled with NativeWind, using Supabase for serverless backend and real-time database updates. Integrated MapBox for route visualization, Google Places API for location data, and OpenAI for dynamic threat analysis. The app aims to give everyone peace of mind while walking alone, especially in winter months when it gets dark earlier.",

This was a RPA project where I used Power Automate Desktop to stimulate the actions typically required in Mover's Suite to update a status. This project was done because accessing certain things like statuses via the API was extremely difficult, and by using RPA we were able to accomplish a similar effect without usingthe API. Additionally, this served internally as a demo of the possibilities of RPA in conjunction with some of the legacy systems and software in use.",
