      "description": "Built a cross-platform IoT solution at HackViolet 2026 to protect beverages from tampering. The system combines an ESP32 device with capacitive touch sensing to detect when a drink's lid is removed, paired with native iOS (SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin/Compose) mobile apps. When the device detects tampering while armed, it triggers a local buzzer alarm, BLE notification to the paired phone, and automated push notifications plus SMS alerts to emergency contacts via Supabase edge functions. Implemented a custom BLE GATT service for communication between the ESP32 and mobile apps, with offline event queuing so nothing is missed if the phone temporarily disconnects.",

Users are presented with blind side-by-side comparisons of articles from different sources on the same topic, and their votes feed into a Glicko-2 rating system (the same algorithm used in chess rankings) to produce a real-time leaderboard. Also built a Knowledge Blender feature that uses xAI's Grok to synthesize the best parts of multiple sources into a single article. The platform currently integrates five sources: Wikipedia, Grokipedia, Encyclopedia Britannica, Citizendium, and New World Encyclopedia. Separated the Selenium-based web scraping into its own Dockerized backend service to keep the main app lightweight.",

Features include a Kanban task board with urgency multipliers, customizable salary structures mixing base pay with task-based compensation, AI-assisted quality control with Shapley value-based payouts, and auto-generated contracts with e-signatures. Built the ML pipeline (OrbitQCML) to predict first-pass QC approval probability using GitHub PR data with a Random Forest classifier and FastAPI inference endpoint. Also ran Monte Carlo simulations (Orbit-MonteCarlo) to optimize the confidence-scaling and geometric decay parameters for the QC payout system.",

The bot notes the quantity of snipes and provides information like a leaderboard and rules. This as built specifically for Archimedes, but could be applied to any club or community in discord since it was generalized. Simply target a channel, and then it can calculate the totals as needed. This also allows it to be in place, or not be used before, as it does a running calculation and then caches it on each bot restart. This provides a bit of flexibility, and since not a ton of data is being cached, it works fine in comparison to using a database, which would require 100% uptime. I maintain the project and deal with any new features or issues as they arrive",

We got a basic version of this working at the hackathon, particularly integrating with Canvas itself, but decided to not continue due to just how complicated making an original note-taking application is, and how much time it would take to even get to an MVP.",
