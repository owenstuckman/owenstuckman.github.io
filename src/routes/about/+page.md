## A Little Bit About Me:

I am an undergraduate student studying computer science, with a minor in cybersecurity at Virginia Tech.  
  
My professional interest is currently focused on automation, be it cloud based, or desktop based robotic process automation. I enjoy creating and improving systems so people can spend time on things that matter rather than an inefficiency or manual analog.  
  
My work experience is through an internship and seasonal employment at Planes, where I mainly worked on RPA. I also Co-Founded and Co-Own a business, Sprklii LLC, where we actively have our product on the app store.  
  
In my free time, I like to run, play spikeball and pickleball, and to work on my personal projects and businesses. And backpack. A lot.
