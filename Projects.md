# Extended Information

## Website Creation:

Played around with a bunch of different options to make the website. Tried out jekyll, which I did not like, used Weebly on Porkbun to make it no-code (which felt clunky), and considered using Hugo. In the end, I decided to just go with plain old markdown, and maybe add a nicer looking theme at the completion of writing the raw markdown. 

Date of Project: October 2024

Done as a Personal Project.

Skills: Markdown, and obsidian.

## AdaptiveSpec Logistics
Startup Sprint 2024 

Created a web scraping tool specifically for specialized logistics. Built framework where selected companies were added to a personal/company wide database, which then pushed those selections to the top of the searches. Did not complete but want to add an ML model to learn through user interaction with the application and push certain traits up further on results, which will end up being a future project. 

Date of Project: October 2024

Did it solo in a competition with teams of up to four.

Skills: Web Scraping: Scrapy. Cloud Database: Supabase. Language: Python. 

Link: Private since I may monetizw this software in the future.

## Archimedes
Design Team at Virginia Tech.

Competing in Microsoft's Imagine Cup. Our team is still in problem ideation, so we are yet to determine what project and frameworks we will use!

Project Began: September 2024

Group - Team of Four

Skills: Flutter

Link: Still in problem ideation!

## SeeFood
VTHacks12

Worked in a team of four to make a tool which was an AI cooking assistant. It provided feedback on a wide variety of inputs, such as cooking time, and if items were spoiled or not. I primarily worked on the UI in Unity and made the dictation tool to enable voice commands, which then communicated with our backend to provide the requested service. 

Date of Project: September 2024

Group - Team of Four: Focused  on UI + dictation work.

Skills: AR/VR : Unity. Cloud Database: Azure. Language: C#. Backend: Node.js. AI: OpenAI ChatGPT 4o. Dictation: Meta XR Voice.

# Planes Moving and Storage - Seasonal Software Engineer
The following subset of projects all were done Summer 2024 at Planes Moving and Storage on my own, with a few that I used to help teach others by having them work on a project. 

### Mover's Suite API Connection
Connect to Mover's Suites outdated API so data can be passed back and forth in an automated manner. Previously had no way to pass data between Mover's Suite and company SQL Server, so this was major in data control and automation for Planes

Skills: Python, TKinter, APIs & http requests

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/tree/main/References-24/References-24/MSAPI

### Mover's Suite Automated Status Updates
Created a desktop RPA using Power Automate Desktop to automate the manual task of changing statuses in Mover's Suite. Prior to this RPA, this was a task that had to be done manually.

Skills: Power Automate Desktop

Link: On Physical Device

### Employee Education
Taught peers about multiple topics: Application Lifecycle Management, Microsoft Dataverse, Git and Github, Exporting from Power BI, Power Platform, SQL Server and SQL, Cloud Based Storage. Worked to generally educate peers to form citizen developers, and to have a better understanding of computer science topics.

Link: Contact me for the particular presentations.

### XPM to Smartsheet Data Connection
Created a cloud automation to pass data between two of our systems, XPM and smartsheet. Prior to this Project Coordinators would have to manually copy and paste data over, and the automation saved them from having to do so.

Skills: Smartsheet, Power Automate Cloud

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/blob/main/References-24/References-24/Screenshot%202024-08-12%20145246.png

### Project Manager Time Tracking
Project Manager Time Tracker was an time tracking system to replace our previous system built into XPM. This project recreated the functionality of the previous system so it could be accessed in mobile form, and we also automated and simplified the process while developing the new application.

Skills: Power Automate, Power Apps, Excel, Legacy systems

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/blob/main/References-24/References-24/PMTimeTracking_20240731185821.zip

### SmartSheet Supplier Information
Smart Sheet Supplier Information was a project to better centralize all of our supplier information in the microsoft ecosystem. Prior to this project everything was in smartsheet and scattered to multiple files and sheets, and this project centralized all of this information, and automated some of the steps in the process of adding information to the database.

Skills: Smartsheet, Power Automate, Network Drives

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/blob/main/References-24/References-24/SupplierInformationDashboard_20240731185711.zip

### Apple Remmittance automation
This project involved automating the extraction of information from our apple remittances. Apple sends their remittances as text embedded in email, so I had to write an automate to parse the text and save it into an csv so our accounting department could more easily work with it. This way accountants did not need to manually compile this data

Skills: Text Parsing, Regex, Power Automate, CSV File Structure

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/blob/main/References-24/References-24/AppleExtract_20240812163255.zip

## Sprklii LLC
Business Venture

Founded a LLC with the idea of bringing personalization to the date ideas scene. Google and other competitors serve people very generalized and blank ideas, and we serve personalized and customized ideas to keep the Spark Alive! I worked as the only developer to get our MVP + alpha product released, and now lead a team with two other developers as we enter our beta phase.

Project Began: January 2023

Business: Co-Founder, CTO, Primary Developer

Skills: Flutter: Dart. Cloud DB: Supabase- PostgreSQL.

Link: Repo is private. 

## Robot-X Computer Vision
FTC Robotics

Revamped our vision system using OpenCV. This was a pretty widespread project that I did on my own to implement two channels of input rather than just using a single channel of input. Took a huge portion of competition season to complete, but resulted in extremely accurate vision by comparing the channels of input. 

Project: August 2023 to January 2024

Skills: OpenCV, Java

Link: Repo is private.

## Robot-X Software Lead
FTC Robotics

Lead software team at Robot-X for three years, with around three members working for me on the subteam. Worked to introduce agile practices into our workflow, and saw efficiency increases due to it. Got a large amount of experience working as both a PM and working directly on some of the more challenging software we needed to write.

August 2021 - May 2024

Skills: Java, Agile Methodology

Link: All repos are private, some samples are on my github.

# Planes Moving and Storage - IT Intern 
All done Summer of 2022.

### Warehouse Time Tracking App
Revamped out warehouse time tracking system, to both modernize and make the process easier on the data entry and data audit endpoints. Provided a set of data auditing tools so those performing the audit had better tools than going row by row.

Skills: Power Apps, Power Automate, SQL Server

### SOP Sharepoint
Created a sharepoint site and created many Standard Operating Procedures to ensure that employees were on the same page on how processes are supposed to go. Prior to this there was no standard procedures, and assisting in this process helped to improve communication between employees and departments.

Skills: SOP, Process Automation, Lean Six Sigma Principles

## Automatic Garage Door Closer
Created an automatic garage door closing system that physically pressed the garage door button when the garage door was left open for too long. I kept leaving the garage door open while leaving home, so this was a fun project to correct the issue rather than having to fix my memory to close the garage door. Used two radio transceivers, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo to put together the physical product to accompany the software I made. 

Summmer 2021

Skills: Arduino Ide, C++, Basic Circuitry and Radio Communication. 

Link: Contact me for the specific files.

## Kids Like Food 2 (KLF2)
Learned the basics to html and css as a great starting project to make a food blog with a friend. I had a ton of fun, and it taught me a lot about basic programming practices. Used google docs as version control, and I made a ton of mistakes but learned a lot!

2019

Skills: HTML, CSS, JS

Link: Lost in old google accounts.
