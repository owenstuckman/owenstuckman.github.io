# Extended Information

## Website Creation:

Played around with a bunch of different options to make the website. Tried out jekyll, which I did not like, used weebly on porkbun to make it no-code (which felt clunky), and considered using Hugo. In the end, I decided to just go with plain old markdown, and maybe add a nicer looking theme at the completion of writing the raw markdown. 

Date of Project: October 2024

Done as a Personal Project.

Skills: Markdown, and obsidian.

## AdaptiveSpec Logistics
Startup Sprint 2024 

Created a web scraping tool specifically for specialized logistics. Built framework where selected companies were added to a personal/company wide database, which then pushed those selections to the top of the searches. Did not complete, but want to add an ML model to learn through user interaction with the application and push certain traits up further on results, which will end up being a future project. 

Date of Project: October 2024

Did it solo in a competition with teams of up to four.

Skills: Web Scraping: Scrapy. Cloud Database: Supabase. Language: Python. 

Link: Private since I may sell this software in the future.

## SeeFood

Worked in a team of four to make a tool which was an AI cooking assistant. It provided feedback on a wide variety of inputs, such as cooking time, and if items were spoiled or not. I primarily worked on the UI in Unity and made the dictation tool to enable voice commands, which then communicated with our backend to provide the requested service.

# Planes Moving and Storage - Seasonal Software Engineer
The following subset of projects all were done Summer 2024 at Planes Moving and Storage on my own, with a few that I used to help teach others by having them work on a project. 

### Mover's Suite API Connection
Connect to Mover's Suites outdated API so data can be passed back and forth in an automated manner. Previously had no way to pass data between Mover's Suite and company SQL Server, so this was major in data control and automation for Planes

Skills: Python, TKinter, APIs & http requests

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/tree/main/References-24/References-24/MSAPI

### Mover's Suite Automated Status Updates
Created a desktop RPA using Power Automate Desktop to automate the manual task of changing statuses in Mover's Suite. Prior to this RPA, this was a task that had to be done manually.

Skills: Power Automate Desktop

Link: On Physical Device

### Employee Education
Taught peers about multiple topics: Application Lifecycle Management, Microsoft Dataverse, Git and Github, Exporting from Power BI, Power Platform, SQL Server and SQL, Cloud Based Storage. Worked to generally educate peers to form citizen developers, and to have a better understanding of computer science topics.

Link: Contact me for the particular presentations.

### XPM to Smartsheet Data Connection
Created a cloud automation to pass data between two of our systems, XPM and smartsheet. Prior to this Project Coordinators would have to manually copy and paste data over, and the automation saved them from having to do so.

Skills: Smartsheet, Power Automate Cloud
