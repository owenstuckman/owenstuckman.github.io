# Extended Information

## Website Creation:

Played around with a bunch of different options to make the website. Tried out jekyll, which I did not like, used weebly on porkbun to make it no-code (which felt clunky), and considered using Hugo. In the end, I decided to just go with plain old markdown, and maybe add a nicer looking theme at the completion of writing the raw markdown. 

Date of Project: October 2024
Done as a Personal Project.

Skills: Markdown, and obsidian.

## AdaptiveSpec Logistics
Startup Sprint 2024 

Created a web scraping tool specifically for specialized logistics. Built framework where selected companies were added to a personal/company wide database, which then pushed those selections to the top of the searches. Did not complete, but want to add an ML model to learn through user interaction with the application and push certain traits up further on results, which will end up being a future project. 

Date of Project: October 2024
Did it solo in a competition with teams of up to four.

Skills: Web Scraping: Scrapy. Cloud Database: Supabase. Language: Python. 
Link: Private since I may sell this software in the future.
