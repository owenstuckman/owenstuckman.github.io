## Website Creation:

Played around with a bunch of different options to make the website. Tried out jekyll, which I did not like, used weebly on porkbun to make it no-code (which felt clunky), and considered using Hugo. In the end, I decided to just go with plain old markdown, and maybe add a nicer looking theme at the completion of writing the raw markdown. 

Date of Project: October 2024
Done as a Personal Project.
