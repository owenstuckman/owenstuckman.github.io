<h2>Project Torch</h2>
    <p><strong>Date of Project:</strong> Late October 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Cryptography techniques, technical knowledge</p>
    <p> Competed in a CIA Pilot for a gameified program to get college studens involved and connected with the CIA. Completely daily cryptography puzzles over a series of three weeks that followed an overall storyline. The puzzles covered a wide range of cryptographic techniques and was extremely fun. Included some elements of physical objects and having to travel to various places on campus to gather clues to solve puzzles. Most puzzles took beyond multiple hours to solve or crack, and was a fun and exciting challenge. </p>
    <p>Done completely for fun.</p>

    <p> Mainly assisted in building the framework to enable quick website creation for local businesses. This framework also allowed business owners to quickly change the items and other peices of their website, without having to use a tool like shopify which would become a reoccuring expense. Additionally, we took care of building out the websites and customizing them to their liking. </p>

    <p>Built a project for the inaugural Marriot Codefest where we connected travelers and locals via a chat application. This app also provided customized itineraries based off of the users inputs and preferences. The information from the chats fed making both the itineraries and a chat bot you could converse with if no locals were available at the time. </p>

    <p>Played around with a bunch of different options to make the website. Tried out jekyll, which I did not like, used Weebly on Porkbun to make it no-code (which felt clunky), and considered using Hugo. In the end, I decided to just go with plain old markdown, and maybe add a nicer looking theme at the completion of writing the raw markdown.</p>

# Planes Moving and Storage - Seasonal Software Engineer
The following subset of projects all were done Summer 2024 at Planes Moving and Storage on my own, with a few that I used to help teach others by having them work on a project. 

### Mover's Suite API Connection
Connect to Mover's Suites outdated API so data can be passed back and forth in an automated manner. Previously had no way to pass data between Mover's Suite and company SQL Server, so this was major in data control and automation for Planes

Skills: Python, TKinter, APIs & http requests

Link: https://github.com/owenstuckman/PlanesReferences/tree/main/References-24/References-24/MSAPI

### Mover's Suite Automated Status Updates
Created a desktop RPA using Power Automate Desktop to automate the manual task of changing statuses in Mover's Suite. Prior to this RPA, this was a task that had to be done manually.

Skills: Power Automate Desktop

Link: On Physical Device

### Employee Education
Taught peers about multiple topics: Application Lifecycle Management, Microsoft Dataverse, Git and Github, Exporting from Power BI, Power Platform, SQL Server and SQL, Cloud Based Storage. Worked to generally educate peers to form citizen developers, and to have a better understanding of computer science topics.

Link: Contact me for the particular presentations.

### XPM to Smartsheet Data Connection
Created a cloud automation to pass data between two of our systems, XPM and smartsheet. Prior to this Project Coordinators would have to manually copy and paste data over, and the automation saved them from having to do so.

Skills: Smartsheet, Power Automate Cloud

### Apple Remmittance automation
This project involved automating the extraction of information from our apple remittances. Apple sends their remittances as text embedded in email, so I had to write an automate to parse the text and save it into an csv so our accounting department could more easily work with it. This way accountants did not need to manually compile this data

Skills: Text Parsing, Regex, Power Automate, CSV File Structure

## Automatic Garage Door Closer
Created an automatic garage door closing system that physically pressed the garage door button when the garage door was left open for too long. I kept leaving the garage door open while leaving home, so this was a fun project to correct the issue rather than having to fix my memory to close the garage door. Used two radio transceivers, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo to put together the physical product to accompany the software I made.
