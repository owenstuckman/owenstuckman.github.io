## A Little Bit About Me

I am an undergraduate student pursuing computer science at Virginia Tech.

My professional interest is currently focused on automation, be it cloud-based or desktop-based robotic process automation. I enjoy creating and improving systems so people can spend time on things that matter rather than inefficiencies or manual tasks.

My work experience includes an internship and seasonal employment at Planes, where I primarily worked on RPA. I also co-founded and co-own a business, Sprklii LLC, with our product actively available on the app store.

In my free time, I like to run, play spikeball and pickleball, work on my personal projects and businesses, and backpackâ€”a lot.
