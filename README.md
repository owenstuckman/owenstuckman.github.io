This is my personal portfolio site, the current site is mdsvex, which is a combination of markdown and svelte, which runs a preprocessor to process the markdown.

# Background

Both for recuiters and myself to keep track of all the projects I have done historically, as there are some projects which are private/inaccessible, and I eant to retain all the project info.

All of the projects were completed on my own, seperate from any organizations. These are all personal project or group projects which I have led or played a major role in.

# Project Progression 

The project originally started as a html/css static site, which I then converted to a pure markdown site. I then grew from the pure markdown site to want some more customizable features, so I converted to mdsvex. 

Overall really like markdown for any of my notetaking or long term information storage, so overall was an obvious choice.
