# Hi! I am Owen!

This is my personal projects site - I wanted to get as bare bones as possible for a change, so this entire site is just markdown, nothing fancy and straight to the point.

## A Little Bit About Me:

I am a undergraduate student pursuing computer science at Virginia Tech.  
  
My interest is primarily focused on automation, be it cloud based or desktop based robotic process automation. I have an interest in process, creating and improving process so people can spend time on things that matter rather than an inefficiency or manual analog.  
  
My experience lies with an internship and seasonal employment at Planes, where I more or less worked on the interest described above. I also Co-Founded and Co-Own a business, Sprklii LLC, where we actively have our product on the app store.  
  
In my free time, I like to run, play spikeball and pickleball, and to work on my personal projects and businesses. And backpack. A lot.
